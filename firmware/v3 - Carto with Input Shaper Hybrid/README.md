If you are using a version of Klipper that is older than v0.12.0-85 

Use the firmware from that folder.

If you are using a version of Klipper later than that, please use the latest firwmare in this folder. 

A guide on how to upgrade or downgrade the firwmare will be avialable on docs.cartographer3d.com - at the time of this push it isn't avialable, but should be within 12 hours.
